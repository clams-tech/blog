<hr />
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>It all started with a simple question: <strong><em>Can we live on a Bitcoin standard today?</em></strong></p>
<p>To find out, we ran Lightning nodes for daily payments and paired them with services like <a href="https://www.bitrefill.com/">Bitrefill</a>. The challenges quickly became apparent: every spend triggered a taxable event, and accounting for complex scenarios‚Äîlike force-closed channels‚Äîturned into a logistical nightmare.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs just Lightning. Like many Bitcoin holders, we have funds spread across various setups: single-sig, multi-sig, and mobile wallets. Meanwhile, new payment protocols like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-ark-plans-to-scale-private-bitcoin-payments">Ark</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/cashu-a-vision-for-a-bitcoin-powered-ecash-ecosystem">Cashu</a>, along with emerging economic models like <a href="https://www.samara-ag.com/market-insights/value-for-value"><em>Value for Value</em></a>, are adding even more layers of complexity.</p>
<p>This abundance of options makes Bitcoin incredibly powerful‚Äîbut also increasingly difficult to track and manage.</p>
<p>The reality? Most Bitcoin holders avoid spending because tracking capital gains is tedious and time-consuming. For businesses, generating essential reports like profit and loss statements or cash flow analyses is even harder.</p>
<p>Bitcoin may be the best form of money, but it‚Äôs far from practical for everyday use.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="current-landscape">Current Landscape</h3>
<p>When tax season arrived, we had no choice but to write custom scripts to convert our Lightning node data into a format compatible with existing accounting software. The process was technical, time-consuming, and required sharing sensitive financial data with third parties.</p>
<p>To our surprise, many Bitcoiners face the same struggle‚Äîspending weekends reconciling transactions every year. Hiring professionals isn‚Äôt much better: it‚Äôs expensive, manual, and still invasive.</p>
<p>While ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù accounting tools exist, they often fall short for Bitcoin holders. Most focus on simple on-chain transactions and overlook the complexities of protocols like Lightning. This left us wondering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many Bitcoiners are held back by these same challenges?</li>
<li>Could accounting be a hidden barrier to Bitcoin adoption?</li>
<li>What if there were a platform that respected privacy and autonomy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, there‚Äôs no Bitcoin-first solution that addresses these issues.</p>
