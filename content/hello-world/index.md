### Background

It started with a simple question: **_Can we live on a Bitcoin standard today?_**

To find out, we ran Lightning nodes for daily payments and paired them with services like Bitrefill and MoonPay. The challenges became clear quickly: every spend was a taxable event, and accounting‚Äîespecially for complex transactions like force-closed channels‚Äîturned into a logistical nightmare.

And Lightning is just one part of the puzzle. Bitcoin exists in many forms‚Äîon-chain, off-chain, custodial, and non-custodial‚Äîspread across various places like single-sig, multi-sig and mobile wallets. Emerging payment protocols like Ark and Cashu add even more options, while economic models like _Value for Value_ are redefining how creators interact with their audiences. This optionality makes Bitcoin powerful, but also much harder to track and manage.

The reality? Most Bitcoin holders avoid spending because tracking capital gains is tedious and time-consuming. For businesses, the challenges are even greater when trying to generate essential reports like profit and loss or cash flow.

Bitcoin may be the best money, but without a dedicated accounting tool, it‚Äôs far from practical for everyday use.

### Current Solutions

When tax season arrived, we had no choice but to write custom scripts to convert our Bitcoin data to a format compatible with traditional accounting software. The process was highly technical and time-consuming. Worse, it required sharing sensitive financial information with third parties. Hiring professionals wasn‚Äôt a much better option: it was expensive, manual, and still invasive.

To our surprise, many Bitcoiners face the same struggle‚Äîspending weekends reconciling transactions every year.

While ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù accounting tools exist, they often fall short for Bitcoin users. Most focus on simple on-chain transactions and overlook the complexities of Lightning, multi-sig setups, or newer payment protocols. This left us wondering:

- How many Bitcoiners are held back by these same challenges?
- Could accounting be a hidden barrier to Bitcoin adoption?
- What if there were a platform that respected privacy and autonomy

Today, there‚Äôs no Bitcoin-first solution that addresses these issues.

**Enter Clams**: a desktop app that provides a complete view of your Bitcoin holdings while preserving privacy. Built for individuals and businesses alike, Clams is designed to make Bitcoin accounting effortless.
