### Background

It started with a simple question: **_Can we live on a Bitcoin standard today?_**

To find out, we ran Lightning nodes for daily payments and paired them with services like Bitrefill and MoonPay. The main challenges became clear: every spend was a taxable event, and accounting for complex transactions, like force-closed channels, became a logistical nightmare.

#### Growing Complexity

Many holders spread funds across various places like single-sig, multi-sig, and mobile wallets. Emerging payment protocols like Ark and Cashu are adding even more options. New economic models like _Value for Value_ are redefining how creators interact with their audiences.

All of this optionality makes Bitcoin powerful but also harder to track and manage.

The reality? Most Bitcoin holders avoid spending because tracking capital gains is tedious and time-consuming. For businesses, trying to generate essential reports like profit and loss or cash flow is even harder.

Bitcoin may be the best money, but without a dedicated accounting tool, it’s far from practical for everyday use.

### Current Landscape

When tax season arrived, we had no choice but to write custom scripts to convert our Lightning node data into a format compatible with existing accounting software. The process was technical, time-consuming, and required sharing sensitive financial data with third parties.

To our surprise, many Bitcoiners face the same struggle—spending weekends reconciling transactions every year. Hiring professionals isn’t much better: it’s expensive, manual, and still invasive.

While “crypto” accounting tools exist, they often fall short for Bitcoin holders. Most focus on simple on-chain transactions and overlook the complexities of protocols like Lightning. This left us wondering:

- How many Bitcoiners are held back by these same challenges?
- Could accounting be a hidden barrier to Bitcoin adoption?
- What if there were a platform that respected privacy and autonomy?

Today, there’s no Bitcoin-first solution that addresses these issues.
